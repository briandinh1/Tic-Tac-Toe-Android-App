# Tic-Tac-Toe-Android-App
Tic tac toe for Android with minimax AI. Basically took my other Connect K project and ported it to Android.

This was a lot less complex than the connect K because its just a 3x3 board


Able to play with 2 human players, or set it to AI mode with a minimax algorithm. 

Did not port over the iterative deepening or alpha beta pruning because I didn't think Tic Tac Toe needs it. You never win against the AI anyway :)
